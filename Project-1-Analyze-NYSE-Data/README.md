## Project #1 - ðŸ’µ Analyze NYSE Data

### Project Summary
This project involved working in Excel and Powerpoint to analyze a dataset containing historical financial data of S&P 500 companies from the NYSE. I was required to calculate summary statistics and draw any inference from the statistics, create visual tools to communicate the results of the analysis, and build financial models and dashboards for a particular company within the dataset.

### Tools & Technologies
* Excel
* Powerpoint

### Dataset Used
The data is a subset of a larger dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse) which had been cleaned and processed by Udacity for the purpose of this project, combining 2 of the 4 .csv files contained in the dataset; _fundamentals.csv_ and _securities.csv._
