## Project #1 - ðŸ’µ Analyze NYSE Data

### Project Overview
This project involved working in Excel to analyze a dataset containing historical financial data of S&P 500 companies from the NYSE. I was required to calculate summary statistics and draw any inference from the statistics, create visual tools to communicate the results of the analysis, and build financial models and dashboards for particular companies within the dataset.
