## Project #1 - ðŸ’µ Analyze NYSE Data

### Project Summary
This project involves working within Excel and Powerpoint to analyze a dataset containing historical financial data of S&P 500 companies from the NYSE. I am required to calculate summary statistics and draw any inference from the statistics, create visual tools to communicate the results of the analysis, and build financial models and dashboards for companies within the dataset.

### Course Outline and Syllabus
Here is the [course outline](https://www.udacity.com/course/business-analytics-nanodegree--nd098).

### Tools & Technologies
* Excel
* Powerpoint
* Juypter Notebook with pandas

### Dataset Used
The data is a subset of a larger dataset provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dgawlik/nyse) which had been cleaned and processed by Udacity for the purpose of this project, combining 2 of the 4 .csv files contained in the dataset; _fundamentals.csv_ and _securities.csv._

### Additional Information
Although I originally conducted my analysis within the confides of Excel and Powerpoint, for the purpose of displaying my project and final analysis through Github, I will be using a Juypter notebook using pandas at times to display my work.
