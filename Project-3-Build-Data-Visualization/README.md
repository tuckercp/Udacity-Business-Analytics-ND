## Project #3 - Build a Data Visualization Project üñºÔ∏è

### Project Summary
The goal of this project is to create a set of visualizations with Tableau that reveal insights from a dataset. The visualizations should reflect the principles and practices of good data visualization, i.e. visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

### Dataset Used
The data comes from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays), and tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large airline carriers in 2015. 

There are 3 .csv files in the dataset; _flights.csv, airlines.csv and airports.csv_. The _flights.csv_ must be used, while the other two provided files are optional.

### Task
I have been asked to build 3 visualizations for this project. The first must be a dashboard that encompasses several different worksheets. The two other visualizations can include single worksheets, additional dashboards or stories, or orher combinations. The visualizations must also meet the following criteria:

incorporate interaction or animation
