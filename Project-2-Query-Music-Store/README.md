## Project #2 - ðŸŽ¹ Query a Digital Music Store Database

### Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to generate a series of questions to be answered through SQL queries. The findings from the queries can then be used to help the marketing team better understand their digital media, customers & employees, and invoice information. Each query will then be exported to Excel and then imported into Powerpoint, being presented over a series of slides demonstrating the findings.

### Tools & Technologies

* SQL
* Excel
* Powerpoint
* Juypter Notebook

### Database Used
The data comes from the sample Chinook database available [here](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/tree/master) on Github. I have cloned the repo to this directory as well. In order to download the .sql file to view the database, navigate to the DataSources directory within the repo to find the appropriate file for the RDBMS you are running on your local machine.

### Additional Information
The original project was carried out using the DB Browser for SQLite, along with Excel and Powerpoint for exporting the queries and generating the slides. However in order to showcase my work here on Github, I am using a Juypter notebook to display my queries alongside the insights found.
