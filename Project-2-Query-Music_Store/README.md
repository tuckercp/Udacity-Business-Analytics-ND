## Project #2 - ðŸŽ¹ Query a Digital Music Store Database

### Project Summary
The purpose of this project is to generate a series of questions to be answered through SQL queries. The findings from the queries can then be used to help the marketing team better understand their digital media, customers & employees, and invoice information. Each query will then be exported to the Microsoft Office suite (Excel & Powerpoint), and presented over a series of slides demonstrating the findings.

### Tools & Technologies

* SQL
* Excel
* Powerpoint
* Juypter Notebook

### Dataset Used
The data comes from the sample Chinook database from the DB Browser for SQLite. I have cloned the repo, [chinook_database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database/tree/master) to this directory. In order to download the .sql file to view the database, navigate to the DataSources directory within that repo to find the appropriate file for the RDBMS you are running on your local machine.

### Additional Information
The original project was carried out within SQLite, along with Excel and Powerpoint for exporting the queries and generating the slides. However, I am using a Juypter notebook to display my queries alongside the insights found.
